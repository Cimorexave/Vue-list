The progress of this project/challenge was 
pretty straight forward. 
first, the whole app is consisting of two parts;
one where there is the checkboxes with the icons
and then there is the part where items appear 
according to what checkbox has been checked. 
so in the first step the whole layout was setup;
header and the checkboxes were put and a component of
the items were built and imported to the app root.
then it was time to set out the layout for the items that 
had three props; the icon, the description and the number.
the data was added and passed into the items
for each item seperately.
Then it was time to add an event and attach it
to the checkboxes which fire functions that 
change the state of each item type.
if it's true it will be shown by a conditional
rendering inside a div and if it was off like the default 
unchecked checkboxes nothing will render.
The rest is pretty simple as well. there is a 
loop which iterates for each item in the type item.
And I think that was pretty much it. In order to
do this project I had to figure out how vue works
cause I had never worked with it so I had to 
convert my knowledge and experience from React mostly
into this. After doing this I must stay I had fun doing it
and now I fund Vue actually more enjoyable and straight forward
and easier to work with. 
And in the end, if there is anything unclear about 
the code and the process in which I explained
please go ahead and ask me.
